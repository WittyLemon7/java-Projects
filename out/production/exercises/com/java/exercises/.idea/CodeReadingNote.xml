        <note>Check if Number is Negative:

If the number is negative, we print &quot;Invalid Value&quot; and exit the method.

Reverse the Number:

We reverse the number so that we can process the digits from left to right.

For example, if the number is 123, reversing it gives 321.

Get Digit Counts:

We get the count of digits in the original number and the reversed number. This helps us handle any leading zeros later.

For example, if the number is 100, the digit count is 3, and the reversed number is 001 (or just 1 with leading zeros considered).

Print Digits in Words:

We extract each digit from the reversed number and use a switch statement to print the corresponding word.

For example, the digit 1 is printed as &quot;One&quot;.

Handle Leading Zeros:

If the original number had trailing zeros (e.g., 100), we add the appropriate number of &quot;Zero&quot; words at the end.

This ensures that numbers like 100 are printed as &quot;One Zero Zero&quot;.

Here's a simpler explanation with an example:

Let's say we have the number 103:

Reverse the Number: Reversed number is 301.

Get Digit Counts: Original digit count is 3, reversed digit count is 3.

Print Digits in Words:

Extract 1 (from 301), print &quot;One&quot;.

Extract 0 (from 301), print &quot;Zero&quot;.

Extract 3 (from 301), print &quot;Three&quot;.

Handle Leading Zeros: No trailing zeros to handle in this case.
