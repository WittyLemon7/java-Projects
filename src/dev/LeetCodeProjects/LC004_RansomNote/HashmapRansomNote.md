# Hash Map version of Ransom Note

```java
public classRansomNote {
    public static boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        // Create a frequency map for characters in the magazine
        Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Count characters in the magazine
        for (char c : magazine.toCharArray()) {
            charCount.put(c, charCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Check if we can construct the ransom note
        for (char c : ransomNote.toCharArray()) {
            if (!charCount.containsKey(c) || charCount.get(c) <= 0) {
                return false; // Character not available or used up
            }
            charCount.put(c, charCount.get(c) - 1); // Use the character
        }
        
        return true; // All characters needed are available
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String ransomNote = "aa";
        String magazine = "aab";
        
        System.out.println(canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine)); // Output: true
    }
}
```
### Explanation
- **Frequency Map**: We use a `HashMap` to count the occurrences of each character in the `magazine`.

- **Character Count**: For each character in the `magazine`, we increment its count in the map.

- **Check Ransom Note**: For each character in the `ransomNote`, we check if it exists in the map and if its count is greater than zero. If not, we return `false`.

- **Decrement Count**: If the character is available, we decrement its count in the map to indicate that it has been used.

- **Return True**: If we successfully check all characters in the `ransomNote`, we return `true`, indicating that the ransom note can be constructed from the magazine.
- ### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the length of the `ransomNote` and m is the length of the `magazine`. We traverse both strings once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the size of the character set is fixed (e.g., ASCII characters), the space used by the `HashMap` is constant in terms of character count.
