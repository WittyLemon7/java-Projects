# 🧠 LeetCodeProjects

> A curated collection of Java-based LeetCode solutions — each one refined, annotated, and purposefully implemented as part of my ongoing mastery of data structures, algorithms, and clean coding practices.

## ✅ Completed Problems

| Problem Name                    | Concepts Practiced                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| RansomNote                      | HashMaps, character frequency      |
| FizzBuzz                        | Modulo operations, logic flows     |
| MiddleOfLinkedList             | Linked lists, fast & slow pointers |
| NumberOfStepsToZero             | Bitwise logic, parity checks       |

Each problem includes:
- Clean Java implementation (`.java`)
- Thoughtful structure and naming
- PDW-style notes (external) for concept mapping and revision

## 🧪 Philosophy & Purpose

This folder is more than just problem-solving:
- I aim to **understand, not memorize**
- I explore **multiple approaches** before finalizing a solution
- I maintain strong documentation habits for long-term retention
- I use these projects to benchmark progress across key CS topics

Each subfolder may include:
- Problem source/reference
- Solution variants
- Notes or diagrams (optional, stored externally)
  ## 🚧 In Progress / Roadmap
  Upcoming problems may focus on:
- Arrays & Sliding Window
- Hashing strategies
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming
- Bitwise puzzles and space/time optimized versions
## 🛡️ Status
This folder is private-use only — intended for personal learning, reflection, and refinement. No boilerplate code. No AI-autogenerated shortcuts. Just clean, real logic.
