# 🔀Reverse an Array

## 📌Problem Statement
Write a method to reverse an array of integers in place.

## 💭Discussion
Reversing an array is a common algorithmic problem that helps solidify understanding of array manipulation, indexing, and iteration. The goal is to swap elements from the start and end of the array until reaching the middle.

## 🖊️Walkthrough
```java
private static void reverseArray(int[] array) {
        int start = 0;// Get the first index of the array
        int end = array.length - 1;// Get the last index of the array

        while (start < end) {// While start index is less than end index
            // Swap elements
            int temp = array[start];// Store the start element in a temporary variable
            array[start] = array[end];// Assign the end element to the start index
            array[end] = temp;// Assign the temporary variable (start element) to the end index

            start++;// Move the start index to the right
            end--;// Move the end index to the left
        }
}
```
🔹The `reverseArray` method takes an integer array as input.

🔹It initializes two pointers: `start` at the beginning and `end` at the last index of the array.

🔹The method uses a `while` loop to iterate until the `start` index is less than the `end` index.

🔹Inside the loop, it swaps the elements at the `start` and `end` indices using a temporary variable.

🔹After swapping, it increments the `start` index and decrements the `end` index to move towards the middle of the array.

## 💡Logic & Explanation
- **Initialization**: The method starts by initializing two pointers, `start` and `end`, to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.
- **Swapping Elements**: The method enters a loop that continues until the `start` pointer is less than the `end` pointer. Inside the loop, it swaps the elements at these indices using a temporary variable.
- **Incrementing/Decrementing Pointers**: After each swap, the `start` pointer is incremented, and the `end` pointer is decremented to move towards the middle of the array.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when the `start` pointer meets or exceeds the `end` pointer, ensuring that all elements have been swapped.
- **In-Place Reversal**: The method modifies the original array without using additional space, making it efficient in terms of memory usage.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as each element is accessed and swapped once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since no additional data structures are used, and the reversal is done in place.


## ⚠️Edge Cases
- **Empty Array**: If the input array is empty, the method should handle it gracefully without any errors.
- **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, it should remain unchanged.
- **Even Length Array**: Ensure that the method correctly handles arrays with an even number of elements.
- **Odd Length Array**: Ensure that the method correctly handles arrays with an odd number of elements, leaving the middle element unchanged.
- **Negative Indices**: Ensure that the method does not attempt to access negative indices, which could lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- **Null Input**: If the input array is null, the method should handle it gracefully, possibly by throwing an exception or returning an empty array.

## Use Case
Reversing an array is useful in various scenarios, such as:
- **Data Processing**: Reversing the order of elements for algorithms that require it, such as palindrome checks.
- **Game Development**: Reversing arrays can be used in games to manipulate player movements or game states.
- **Data Visualization**: Reversing arrays can help in displaying data in reverse order, such as in charts or graphs.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Reversing arrays can be a step in optimizing algorithms that require data to be processed in reverse order.
- **String Manipulation**: Reversing character arrays to create palindromes or for string reversal operations.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Some sorting algorithms may require reversing parts of an array to achieve the desired order.
