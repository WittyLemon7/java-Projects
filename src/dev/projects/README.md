# Java Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Java project workspace! This repository hosts a collection of self-structured projects developed to practice, internalize, and apply core Java concepts. From simple array manipulations to system simulations like hotel bookings and rental services, each directory reflects a focused problem domain and an object-oriented approach to solution building.

## 📁 Project Overview

- `BurgerJoint` – An object-oriented model for burger combinations using inheritance and composition.
- `CarPolymorphism` – Demonstrates runtime polymorphism with car behaviors in different subclasses.
- `CarRentalManagementSystem` – A modular system simulating rental logistics, inventory, and billing.
- `CinemaHallBookingSystem` – Seat reservation logic with availability tracking for multiple showtimes.
- `ClassesChallenge` – Exploratory challenges to deepen class design and encapsulation skills.
- `EncapsulationPrinterChallenge` – Encapsulated printer logic managing toner levels and duplex mode.
- `Exercise_and_Practice` – A rotating set of small challenges for improving syntax and problem-solving fluency.
- `GroceryStoreChallenge` – Inventory and pricing management for a simulated retail scenario.
- `HotelBookingSystem` – Room allocation and reservation system using composition and array logic.
- `InheritanceComputerFactory` – Demonstrates inheritance and constructor chaining through a computer parts factory simulation.
- `MinimumElement` – Simple recursive and iterative techniques for finding the smallest value in arrays.
- `RestaurantManagement` – Order tracking and item management for a simulated dining experience.
- `ReverseArray` – Multiple approaches to in-place and auxiliary array reversal.
- `RoomComposition` – A focus on composition-based modeling to simulate interior environments.
- `SmartKitchen` – Bundled appliance operations using method calls, interfaces, and task toggling.
- `WorkerChallenge` – Abstracted employee behaviors showcasing method overriding and hierarchy-based payroll logic.

## 💡 Design Philosophy

All projects follow:
- **Java package conventions** for structure and readability
- A **modular layout** to isolate features and responsibilities
- Emphasis on **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**
- Logical **naming conventions** that mirror project functionality
- Code that is **clear, testable**, and ready for future extension

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project is self-contained and runnable in IntelliJ IDEA or any standard Java IDE. Most include a `Main` class with example usages and can be built using basic Java SDK without additional dependencies.

> All code is written with learning-first clarity and practical understanding over optimization or enterprise scalability—for now 😉

## 🛠️ What's Next

I’m currently in the process of reorganizing my Python and Jupyter notebook workspace to mirror the Java folder system. Once that’s complete, a similarly structured portfolio will follow.
