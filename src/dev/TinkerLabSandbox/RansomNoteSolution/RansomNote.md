## Ransom Note

## Problem Statement
Create a Ransom Note class that checks if a ransom note can be constructed from the characters available in a magazine. The magazine contains a collection of characters, and the ransom note requires specific characters to be formed.
## Discussion
The Ransom Note class is designed to determine if a given ransom note can be constructed using characters from a magazine. This involves checking the availability of each character in the magazine and ensuring that the required characters for the ransom note are present in sufficient quantities.
## Walkthrough
```java
 public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {

        for (int i = 0; i < ransomNote.length(); i++) {// Iterate through each character in the ransom note
            char c = ransomNote.charAt(i);// Get the character at the current index
            int matchingIndex = magazine.indexOf(c);// Find the index of the character in the magazine

            if (matchingIndex == -1) {// If the character is not found in the magazine
                return false; // Character not found in magazine
            } else {
                // Remove the character from the magazine to prevent reuse
                magazine = magazine.substring(0, matchingIndex) + magazine.substring(matchingIndex + 1);// Remove the character at the found index
            }
        }
        return true; // All characters in the ransom note were found in the magazine
}
```
## Logic & Explanation
- **Iterate through Ransom Note**: The method iterates through each character in the ransom note.
  - **Find Character in Magazine**: For each character, it checks if the character exists in the magazine using `indexOf()`.
  - **Check Character Availability**: If the character is not found (`indexOf()` returns -1), it returns `false`, indicating that the ransom note cannot be constructed.
  - **Remove Character from Magazine**: If the character is found, it removes that character from the magazine to prevent its reuse in subsequent iterations.
  - **Return True**: If all characters in the ransom note are found in the magazine, it returns `true`, indicating that the ransom note can be constructed.
## Edge Cases
- **Empty Ransom Note**: If the ransom note is empty, it can always be constructed, so the method should return `true`.
- **Empty Magazine**: If the magazine is empty but the ransom note is not, the method should return `false`.
- **Single Character Ransom Note**: If the ransom note consists of a single character, the method should check if that character exists in the magazine.
- **Multiple Occurrences**: If the ransom note requires multiple occurrences of a character, the method should ensure that the magazine contains enough instances of that character.
