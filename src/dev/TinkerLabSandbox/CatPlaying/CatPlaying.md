# Cat Playing 
## Problem Statement
Create a method that simulates a cat playing in the temperature range of 0 to 35 degrees Celsius. The method should return true if the cat is playing, and false otherwise.in the summer the upper limit is 45 degrees Celsius.
## Discussion
The Cat Playing method is designed to determine whether a cat is playing based on the temperature. It checks if the temperature is within a specified range (0 to 35 degrees Celsius) and returns a boolean value indicating whether the cat is playing. This can be useful in scenarios where we want to simulate or model the behavior of a cat in different temperature conditions.
## Walkthrough
```java
public static boolean isCatPlaying(boolean summer, int temperature) {
    if (summer) {
        // In summer, the upper limit is 45 degrees Celsius
        return temperature >= 25 && temperature <= 45;
    } else {
        // In non-summer, the upper limit is 35 degrees Celsius
        return temperature >= 25 && temperature <= 35;
    }
}
```
## Logic & Explanation
- **Parameters**: The method takes two parameters: `summer` (a boolean indicating whether it is summer) and `temperature` (an integer representing the current temperature in degrees Celsius).
- **Conditional Logic**: The method uses an `if` statement to check if it is summer. If it is summer, the upper limit for the temperature is set to 45 degrees Celsius; otherwise, it is set to 35 degrees Celsius.
- **Return Value**: The method returns `true` if the temperature is within the specified range (25 to 45 degrees in summer, or 25 to 35 degrees otherwise), and `false` otherwise. This allows for a clear and concise determination of whether the cat is playing based on the temperature conditions.
## Edge Cases
- **Negative Temperatures**: The method does not explicitly handle negative temperatures. If the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius, it will return `false` regardless of whether it is summer or not.
- **Extreme Temperatures**: If the temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius in summer or 35 degrees Celsius in non-summer, the method will return `false`, indicating that the cat is not playing.
- **Zero Temperature**: If the temperature is exactly 0 degrees Celsius, the method will return `false`, as it is below the minimum threshold for playing.
- **Non-integer Temperatures**: The method assumes that the temperature is provided as an integer. If a non-integer value is passed, it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
