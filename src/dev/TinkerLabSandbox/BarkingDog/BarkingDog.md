# Barking Dog
## Problem Statement
Create a Barking Dog class that simulates a dog barking. The class should have methods to check if the dog should bark based on the time of day and whether it is being called.
## Discussion
The Barking Dog class is designed to simulate the behavior of a dog barking. It includes methods to determine if the dog should bark based on the time of day and whether it is being called. This project helps in understanding basic object-oriented programming concepts such as method implementation, and conditional logic.
## Walkthrough
```java
  //method to determine if dog is barking and if it is time to wake up
    public static void shouldWakeUp(boolean barking, int hourOfDay) {
        if (barking && (hourOfDay < 8 || hourOfDay > 22)) {// if dog is barking and time is before 8am or after 10pm
            System.out.println("Wake up!");
        } else if (!barking) {
            System.out.println("Dog is not barking.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("It's not time to wake up.");
        }
    }
```
## Logic & Explanation
- **Parameters**: The method takes two parameters: `barking` (a boolean indicating if the dog is barking) and `hourOfDay` (an integer representing the current hour in 24-hour format).
- **Conditional Logic**: The method uses an `if` statement to check if the dog is barking and if the current hour is before 8 AM or after 10 PM. If both conditions are true, it prints "Wake up!".
- **Else Conditions**: 
  - If the dog is not barking, it prints "Dog is not barking."
  - If the dog is barking but it's not time to wake up, it prints "It's not time to wake up."
  - This structure allows for clear and concise handling of the dog's barking behavior based on the time of day.
## Edge Cases
- **Invalid Hour**: If `hourOfDay` is less than 0 or greater than 23, the method does not handle this case explicitly. It assumes valid input.
- **Barking State**: If `barking` is false, the method will always print "Dog is not barking." regardless of the hour.
- **Time Boundary Conditions**: The method checks for specific time boundaries (before 8 AM and after 10 PM) but does not handle cases where the hour is exactly 8 AM or 10 PM. In these cases, it will not wake up.
- **Non-24 Hour Format**: The method assumes that `hourOfDay` is provided in a 24-hour format. If a different format is used, the logic may not work as intended.
