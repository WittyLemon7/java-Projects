# Person ID 
## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a Person ID system, which is designed to uniquely identify individuals within a system. The Person ID will be generated based on specific attributes of the person, ensuring that each ID is unique and consistent.
## Discussion
The Person ID system will utilize a combination of personal attributes such as  first name, last name, age & determine if the person is a Teen or Adult. The ID will be generated by concatenating these attributes in a specific format. This approach ensures that the ID is not only unique but also provides some information about the individual.
## Walkthrough
```java
public class PersonID {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private int age;

    public PersonID(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String generatePersonID() {
        String personType = (age < 20) ? "Teen" : "Adult"; // Determine if the person is a Teen or Adult
        return firstName + "_" + lastName + "_" + age + "_" + personType; // Generate the ID
    }
public boolean isTeen() {
        return age < 20; // Check if the person is a Teen
    }

    public boolean isAdult() {
        return age >= 20; // Check if the person is an Adult
    }
}
```
## Logic & Explanation
- **Class Definition**: The `PersonID` class encapsulates the attributes of a person and provides methods to generate a unique ID.
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` attributes.
- **ID Generation**: The `generatePersonID` method constructs the ID by concatenating the first name, last name, age, and a designation of whether the person is a Teen or Adult.
- **Type Checking**: The `isTeen` and `isAdult` methods provide a way to check the age category of the person, returning boolean values based on the age attribute.
## Edge Cases
- **Negative Age**: The program does not handle negative ages. If a negative age is provided, it will still generate an ID, but the logic for determining Teen or Adult may not be appropriate. Consider adding validation to handle negative ages.
- **Empty Names**: If either the first name or last name is empty, the ID will still be generated, but it may not be meaningful. Consider adding validation to ensure that names are not empty.
- **Age Boundary**: The boundary condition for determining Teen (age < 20) and Adult (age >= 20) is straightforward, but ensure that the logic is clear and consistent. If the age is exactly 20, it will be classified as an Adult, which is the intended behavior.
- **Null Values**: The program does not handle null values for the first name or last name. If either is null, it will result in a `NullPointerException` when generating the ID. Consider adding checks to handle null values gracefully, perhaps by throwing an exception or using default values.
## Related Concepts
- **String Manipulation**: The ID generation involves concatenating strings, which is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks.
- **Conditional Logic**: The use of conditional statements to determine the type of person (Teen or Adult) is a common programming practice.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The `PersonID` class demonstrates encapsulation by bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) related to a person into a single unit.
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring that the input data (first name, last name, age) is valid is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Person ID system. Consider implementing additional validation methods to check for valid input before generating the ID.
- **Unique Identifiers**: The concept of generating unique identifiers based on attributes is widely used in databases and systems to ensure that each entity can be uniquely identified. This is particularly important in applications where multiple individuals may have similar names or attributes.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, can help manage exceptions that may arise from invalid input or unexpected conditions. This will enhance the robustness of the Person ID system.
