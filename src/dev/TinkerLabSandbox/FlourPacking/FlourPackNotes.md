# Flour Pack Problem
This problem involves determining if a given amount of flour can be packed into bags of specific sizes, specifically 3kg and 5kg bags. The goal is to find out if it's possible to pack the flour without leaving any remainder.
## Problem Statement
Create a method that takes an integer representing the total amount of flour in kilograms and returns a boolean indicating whether it can be packed into bags of 3kg and 5kg without any leftover flour.
## Discussion
The Flour Pack problem is a classic example of a combinatorial problem where we need to determine if a given amount can be expressed as a sum of multiples of two specific numbers (in this case, 3 and 5). This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm or by checking combinations of the two bag sizes.
## Walkthrough
```java
public class FlourPack {
    // Method to check if the flour can be packed into 3kg and 5kg bags
    public static boolean canPack(int bigCount, int smallCount, int goal) {
        // Check if the goal is negative
        if (goal < 0) {
            return false; // Cannot pack negative flour
        }
        
        // Calculate the maximum amount of flour that can be packed using 5kg bags
        int maxBigFlour = bigCount * 5;
        
        // If the total flour from big bags exceeds the goal, adjust it
        if (maxBigFlour > goal) {
            maxBigFlour = goal - (goal % 5); // Use only enough big bags to not exceed the goal
        }
        
        // Calculate the remaining flour after using big bags
        int remainingFlour = goal - maxBigFlour;
        
        // Check if the remaining flour can be packed with small bags
        return remainingFlour <= smallCount * 3;
    }
}
```
## Logic & Explanation
- **Parameters**: The method `canPack` takes three parameters: `bigCount` (number of 5kg bags), `smallCount` (number of 3kg bags), and `goal` (total amount of flour in kg).
- **Negative Check**: The method first checks if the `goal` is negative. If it is, it returns false, as we cannot pack negative flour.
- **Maximum Big Flour Calculation**: It calculates the maximum amount of flour that can be packed using the 5kg bags. If this exceeds the `goal`, it adjusts the maximum to ensure it does not exceed the goal.
- **Remaining Flour Calculation**: It calculates the remaining flour after using the maximum possible amount of 5kg bags.
- **Small Bag Check**: Finally, it checks if the remaining flour can be packed using the 3kg bags. If the remaining flour is less than or equal to the total amount of flour that can be packed with the small bags, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
- **Return Value**: The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the flour can be packed into the specified bag sizes without any leftover flour.
- **Efficiency**: The method runs in constant time O(1) since it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.
## Edge Cases
- **Negative Goal**: If the goal is negative, the method correctly returns false.
- **Zero Goal**: If the goal is zero, the method returns true, as no flour means no packing is needed.
- **Insufficient Bags**: If there are not enough bags to pack the flour, the method will return false.
- **Exact Fit**: If the goal can be exactly met with the available bags, the method will return true.
- **Large Inputs**: The method handles large inputs efficiently due to its constant time complexity.
- **Zero Bags**: If both `bigCount` and `smallCount` are zero, the method will return true only if the goal is also zero.
## Related Concepts
- [[Combinatorial Problems]]: This problem is a classic example of combinatorial optimization, where we need to find combinations of items to meet a specific goal.
- [[Greedy Algorithms]]: The approach used in this problem can be seen as a greedy algorithm, where we try to use the largest bags first to minimize the remaining flour.
- [[Modular Arithmetic]]: The problem involves checking if the remaining flour can be evenly divided by the size of the small bags, which relates to modular arithmetic.
- [[Input Validation]]: The method includes input validation to ensure that negative goals are handled appropriately, reinforcing the importance of validating inputs in programming.
- [[Boolean Logic]]: The method returns a boolean value, demonstrating the use of boolean logic in programming to represent true/false conditions.
