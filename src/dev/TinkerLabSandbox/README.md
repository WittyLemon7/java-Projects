# 🧪 TinkerLabSandbox

> A private playground for experimenting, refining, and documenting Java-based projects and concepts with precision and curiosity.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

TinkerLabSandbox is a personal space where I:

- Practice **alternative implementations** and logic flows
- Refactor and strengthen **existing project structures**
- Explore **edge cases, optimizations, and patterns**
- Maintain **detailed notes** using PDW-style documentation
- Test **syntax, behavior, and new ideas** before integrating them into production projects

---

## 🔍 What's Inside

- `TINKER_*.java` → Experimentation files for isolated problems or alternate approaches
- `NOTES/` → Handcrafted PDW-style and Cornell-style markdown notes for each topic
- `README_TINKER_PROJECTS.md` → A log of refined insights per problem/project
- `R&D/` → Proof-of-concept logic blocks and scratchpad workflows

> ⚠️ This repo is **private-use only** and does not contain errors — it's a polished sandbox for continuous learning and refinement.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Java fundamentals → revisited with clarity and structure
- Low-level optimization trials using **bitwise logic, masks, and shift ops**
- Visual-linked notes bridging **LinkedLists, HashMaps, and OOP** principles
- Methodical note workflows powered by **Obsidian vaults** and handwritten indexing
