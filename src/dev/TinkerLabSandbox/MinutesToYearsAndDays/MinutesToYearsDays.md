# Minutes To Years And Days
## Problem Statement
Create a program that converts a given number of minutes into years and days. The program should take an integer input representing the number of minutes and output the equivalent number of years and days.
## Discussion
The problem involves converting a time duration given in minutes into years and days. This requires understanding the number of minutes in a year and a day, which are typically defined as follows:
- 1 year = 365 days (ignoring leap years for simplicity)
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Thus, 1 year = 365 * 24 * 60 minutes
- 1 day = 24 * 60 minutes
- The program should handle large inputs and ensure that the output is formatted correctly.
## Walkthrough
```java
//method to convert minutes to years and days
public static void printYearsAndDays(long minutes) {
    if (minutes < 0) {// Check if the input is negative
        System.out.println("Invalid Value");
    } else {
        long years = minutes / (60 * 24 * 365);// Calculate the number of years
        long days = (minutes % (60 * 24 * 365)) / (60 * 24);// Calculate the remaining days after converting to years
        System.out.println(minutes + " min = " + years + " y and " + days + " d");
    }
}
```
## Logic & Explanation
- **Input Validation**: The method first checks if the input `minutes` is negative. If it is, it prints "Invalid Value".
- **Calculating Years**: The number of years is calculated by dividing the total minutes by the number of minutes in a year (60 * 24 * 365).
- **Calculating Days**: The remaining minutes after calculating years are used to calculate the number of days. This is done by taking the modulus of the total minutes with the number of minutes in a year and then dividing by the number of minutes in a day (60 * 24).
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to show the total minutes, the calculated years, and the calculated days in a clear and concise manner.
- **Efficiency**: The method runs in constant time O(1) since it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input size.
## Edge Cases
- **Negative Input**: If the input is negative, the method handles it gracefully by printing "Invalid Value".
- **Zero Input**: If the input is zero, the method will output "0 min = 0 y and 0 d", which is the expected behavior.
