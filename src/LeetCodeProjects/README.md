# LeetCode Solutions

This directory contains my curated solutions to selected LeetCode problems, written with clarity, structure, and performance in mind.

Unlike general experimentation or exploratory code, solutions here reflect:
- Careful attention to **problem constraints and edge cases**
- Clean, well-documented code following **Java best practices**
- Thoughtful tradeoffs in **time and space complexity**
- Consistent naming conventions and modular structure

The goal isnâ€™t just to pass test casesâ€”but to write maintainable, scalable code that aligns with industry standards.

> Each submission is treated like a mini-production-grade task. Code logic and syntax are reviewed more strictly than in other non-LeetCode work.

As I explore new problems and revisit old ones with fresh perspectives, this collection will continue to evolve. Contributions to structure, documentation, or test automation are always welcomeâ€”by Future Me or Collaborator Me ðŸ˜„
