# üöÄ Dev.Projects

Welcome to my personal development hub, `Dev.Projects`! This repository is a structured collection of my Java programming journey, encompassing competitive programming challenges, foundational projects, experimental refactorings, and reusable utility tools.

## üìö Project Structure & Contents

This repository is organized into several key directories to categorize different aspects of my development work:

### üí° `LeetCode`
This folder houses my solutions to various problems from LeetCode. Each problem typically has its own Java file and may include notes on approach, time complexity, and space complexity. This section is continuously updated as I tackle new challenges.

### üèóÔ∏è `main-projects`
This directory contains a collection of standalone Java applications and larger projects. These projects are designed to demonstrate practical application of Java concepts and problem-solving skills.
    
* **Examples of Projects:**
    * **Room Booking System:** A console-based application to manage room reservations.
    * **LMS (Learning Management System):** A system to manage courses, students, and instructors.
    * **Cinema Hall Booking System:** An application for booking movie tickets and managing showtimes.

Many projects within this folder emphasize **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including:
    * **Inheritance:** Demonstrating class hierarchies and code reuse.
    * **Polymorphism:** Showcasing dynamic method dispatch and flexible design.
    * **Encapsulation:** Protecting data and exposing functionality through well-defined interfaces.
    * **Arrays & Collections:** Utilizing fundamental data structures for data management.

#### üéØ `main-projects/exercise`
A sub-folder within `main-projects` dedicated to solving basic Java programming problems. This serves as a foundational practice ground for core language constructs and algorithms.

### üß™ `TinkerLabSandbox`
This is my experimental playground! In this folder, I revisit existing problems or concepts and try to implement them in new, potentially more efficient, or elegant ways. The goal here is to explore alternative algorithms, data structures, and design patterns to deepen my understanding and improve problem-solving approaches.

### üõ†Ô∏è `utility`
This directory is a growing collection of static utility classes designed to handle common tasks and edge cases. The aim is to build a reusable library of functions that can be leveraged across multiple projects, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.
    
* **Example Utility:**
    * **`InputValidator`:** A class for robust input validation, handling common error scenarios and ensuring data integrity.

I continuously add to this folder as I identify repetitive code patterns or discover general-purpose functionalities that can be abstracted into reusable utilities.

## üå± Learning & Development Philosophy

My approach to learning and development is hands-on and iterative. I believe in:
* **Active Problem Solving:** Directly tackling coding challenges.
* **Structured Learning:** Organizing projects and notes methodically.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly refactoring and optimizing code.
* **Documentation:** Explaining logic and thought processes through accompanying notes.

## ü§ù Contribution & Collaboration

This is primarily a personal learning repository. While direct contributions are not expected, I'm always open to discussions, feedback, and learning from others. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or insights!

Happy Coding!
